# ToDo App! 
## The web app that allows you to keep track of tasks created by different people.

The app allows you to **create**, **view**, **update** and **delete** tasks and hasbeen developed following the **MVC** software design pattern.

Each task contains the following information or fields:
- Task name
- Task author
- Task status (Pending / Ongoing / Finished)
- Task start time (the date & time when task status is set to 'Ongoing' - in blank if task status is set to 'Pending')
- Task end time (the date & time when task status is set to 'Finished - in blank if task status is set to 'Pending')

The app allows you to **list** all the tasks and **sort** them by field, both in ascendent and descendent order.

## Structured and Non-structured DataBases
The app is capable of working with 3 types of databases, selectable from the 'home' page:
- **json file**
- **MySQL database**
- **MongoDB database**

## Responsive Design
The app is also responsive, adjusting automatically the contents to the viewport.
